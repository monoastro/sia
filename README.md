## Dependencies
- npm/pnpm

## Getting Started

First, install the necessary packages using the npm as(If you're fancy you can even use pnpm):
```bash
npm i
```
Complex command, I know. Now then, let's run the development server:

```bash

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the locally hosted website.


## Building the project

```bash
npm run build
```
Since the necessary configuration has been already done in package.json, all you need to do is:
```bash
npm run start
```
Which might be confusing to the create-next-app crowd, but checkout package.json for clarity.
