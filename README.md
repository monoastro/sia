## Getting Started

First, install the necessary packages using the npm as(If you're fancy you can even use pnpm):
```bash
npm i
```
Complex command, I know. Now then, let's run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
